"""Iterative block-repair orchestrator.

``run_iterative_block_repair(ctx)`` runs up to MAX_ITERS rounds, configured by
``agent/evodrc.conf``. Each round decomposes the current block into repair
units, repairs every repairable unit with one model call apiece, gates the
resulting patches on connectivity, assembles the ones that pass, re-measures
block DRC and connectivity, and evolves the per-layer knowledge store. It stops
early when the block is DRC-clean or nothing is repairable. Artifacts are
persisted under a deterministic root. By default the last
connectivity-preserving repair is copied to ``output_path``; the optional
best-valid rollback policy instead emits the lowest-DRV complete valid state.
The function returns ``(status, error)``.
