"""Scheduler that dispatches one repair subprocess per leaf.

Each leaf is handled by a ``leaf_runner`` subprocess, and at most
``LEAF_CONCURRENCY`` of them run at once; 0 means all leaves at once. A
worker's stdout and stderr go to a per-leaf file rather than an in-memory
pipe, so file-descriptor and process pressure stays bounded.

That setting is only a per-phase sub-cap. The binding limit is the
process-wide gate in ``throttle``: ``_run_one`` spawns its subprocess inside
``throttle.call_slot``, so the global concurrency cap and the post-process
cooldown apply to repair subprocesses exactly as they do to knowledge calls.
Normally each child makes one model call. Optional bounded alternatives run
sequentially inside the same child while that slot remains held, so they do
not increase the number of in-flight repair subprocesses.
