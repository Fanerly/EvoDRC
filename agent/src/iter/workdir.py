"""Container-local work root, and the lease on the shared scratch dirs.

The persist root sits on a bind mount, so anything written there is copied to
the host and becomes part of the published run record. Working files -- token
dumps, decomposition scratch, knowledge staging, the model's raw patch, runner
logs -- do not belong in that record, so this module places them under a work
root outside every bind mount (``/tmp/evodrc_work/<digest>`` by default),
where they are discarded with the container.

``_inject/`` stays under the persist root on purpose: the rendered prompt
names the injected files by absolute path, so relocating it would change the
prompt bytes. ``EVODRC_WORK_BASE`` is an environment variable rather than a
config key, so the work base cannot be pointed back at the bind mount.
